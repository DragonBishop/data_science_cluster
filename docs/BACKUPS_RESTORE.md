# Backups and Restore

CNPG archives WAL continuously and writes scheduled base backups to SeaweedFS through the Barman Cloud Plugin. `just backup` takes a base backup by hand. The commands that check them are in [Cluster Operations](OPERATIONS.md#database).

## Restoring the Database from SeaweedFS

Recovery with the Barman Cloud Plugin requires the user to roll out this `.yaml` manifest. It bootstraps a *new* cluster from the object store and replays WAL to a chosen point, leaving the original untouched. Define the backup as an external cluster and name it as the bootstrap source:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: postgis-restore
  namespace: databases
spec:
  instances: 1
  # imageName: match apps/databases/postgis-cluster.yaml
  imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgis:18.6-3.6.4-system-trixie
  storage:
    size: 100Gi
    storageClass: local-path
  enableSuperuserAccess: true
  superuserSecret:
    name: postgis-app-credentials
  bootstrap:
    recovery:
      source: postgis-backup-store
      # Omit recoveryTarget to replay every archived WAL segment. To recover to
      # a moment before a mistake, name it here instead:
      # recoveryTarget:
      #   targetTime: "2026-07-30 21:15:00.00000+00"
  externalClusters:
    - name: postgis-backup-store
      plugin:
        name: barman-cloud.cloudnative-pg.io
        parameters:
          barmanObjectName: postgis-backups
          serverName: postgis-cluster
```

`serverName` selects which server's backups to read from the object store. It defaults to the name of the cluster being created, so restoring into a differently-named cluster requires it to be set explicitly to `postgis-cluster`. Without it, the restore finds no backups.

The restore cluster's `storage.size` must be at least the source cluster's. Confirm the space exists before starting:

```bash
df -h /var/lib/rancher/k3s/storage
kubectl apply -f /tmp/postgis-restore.yaml
kubectl get cluster postgis-restore -n databases -w
kubectl cnpg psql postgis-restore -n databases -- postgres -c '\dt'
kubectl delete cluster postgis-restore -n databases
```

Deleting the Cluster leaves its PersistentVolumeClaim behind; remove that too once the restoration is done:

```bash
kubectl delete pvc -n databases -l cnpg.io/cluster=postgis-restore
```
